 Problem:    Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II
 Difficulty: Easy
 Source:     https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node-ii/
 Notes:
 Follow up for problem "Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node".
 What if the given tree could be any binary tree? Would your previous solution still work?
 Note:
 You may only use constant extra space.
 For example,
 Given the following binary tree,
     1
    /  \
   2    3
  / \    \
 4   5    7
 After calling your function, the tree should look like:
     1 -> NULL
    /  \
   2 -> 3 -> NULL
  / \    \
 4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL

 Solution: 1. iterative way with CONSTANT extra space.
           2. iterative way + queue. Contributed by SUN Mian(孙冕).
           3. recursive solution.
