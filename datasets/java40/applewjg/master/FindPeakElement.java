 Problem:    Find Peak Element
 Difficulty: Medium
 Source:     https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/
 Notes:
 A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.
 Given an input array where num[i] ≠ num[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.
 You may imagine that num[-1] = num[n] = -∞.
 For example, in array [1, 2, 3, 1], 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

 Find the peak element.
