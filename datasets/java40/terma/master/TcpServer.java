 * that this worker uses @{link TcpServerHandlerFactory} for create
 * handler @{link TcpServerHandler} and add it to not started handlers queue. All workers
 * have access to this queue.
 *
 * Worker has next lifecycle: try to get one not started handler from queue
 * if it exists register it, then wait on selector with timeout, get IO events
 * for each event get attached handler from key and process it.
 * After that worker returns to step with queue.
